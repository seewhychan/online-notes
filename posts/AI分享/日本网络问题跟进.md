# 日本网络问题跟进

## 🧑‍💻 User

我提供一个邮件的详细内容给你。邮件标题是“Incident Report: Japan Network Degradation - Tunnel 3 Connectivity”。

这是关于日本Tapestry零售店的网络问题（Tunnel3连接），这个邮件去到1月15日就没有后续的更新了。我想再接着这个邮件去催促一下，你提供一下如何用英文委婉且动听来催促这个事情，问一下目前进度如何。

Report Suspicious 

 
Hi Roselier-san,
 
Thanks for the confirmation. However, it seems the frequency of store complaints to SOG has dropped significantly over the past couple of days. We have already manually switched the problematic sites to TUNNEL4 or HK. Let’s continue to monitor the situation to see if a bulk switch is actually necessary.
 
Thanks.

Hi Max,
 
We can failover to HK for the stores that have had callouts first and get SOG involved to see if there is any improvement.
 
Kindest regards.

Please escalating to Singtel and marked high priority to this case as it affects the stability of 200+ stores in Japan to connect to Singapore.
 
@Rosellier Aspiras, We can failover to Hong Kong as a workaround if necessary.

Hi Max,
 
Thank you very much for the updates.
If SG-HE is unstable then I would suggest to completely shut down all connections going through it and just swing to the HK-HE until the said issue is resolved, but I cannot speak for the other regions.
 
Hi @Sunken-san,

My apologies for the callout during a busy time, but will you kindly look into this matter when you have the time?
 
Kindest regards.

Hi Rosellier-san,
 
Please see the attached summary and raw data regarding packet loss from all JP stores to SG, which I collected using a Python script. The packet loss is widespread, significant, and intermittent.
SOG has been receiving numerous complaints from stores recently, placing significant pressure on daily operations. As previously mentioned, the local ISPs in Japan have repeatedly confirmed that there are no issues within their networks. Currently, Singtel in Singapore is investigating the matter (connectivity from SG to multiple regions, including JP, KR, and ANZ, is affected, though KR appears to have improved slightly).
I propose running a script on the FMG to shut down Tunnel 3 (or even both Tunnel 3 and 4) as a workaround.
Please let me know if you approve this action.
 
Thanks.

Dear team,
 
Hope this email finds you well.
As we known, some of Japan stores have recently reported connectivity issues when retrieving customer information at the front desk. 
Upon investigation, we observed packet loss in the network at the time these issues occurred.
As weekend traffic is critical, any continuation of this issue could significantly impact store operations.
Could you please provide us with an update or progress regarding the situation? 
Your support in resolving this matter would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you.

Hi Max,
 
Thank you very much for the update report, and for the quick correspondence in switching to Tunnel 4.
 
I was wondering if the regions using the SGDC as primary is not experiencing the issue, as it is only Japan stores currently affected based on the stores codes.
 
Kindest regards.

Hi Rosellier-san,
 
We are writing to inform you of a recurrence of the network latency and packet loss issue affecting the connectivity between our Japan Stores and the Singapore Data Center (SG DC). This incident exhibits identical symptoms to the outage experienced earlier this week.
Current Status & Mitigation: To restore service stability, we have successfully failed over all affected traffic to the backup path (Tunnel 4).
Observations:
•	Business Impact: Connectivity and business applications should now be stabilizing following the switch to Tunnel 4.
•	Affected Scope: The issue initially impacted the following stores, with the list currently expanding: 
o	D513, J215, J217, J884, J722, J475, J233, J804, J867, J376
o	(Note: We are working with SOG for additional affected locations)
Next Steps: We have escalated this recurrence to the ATT with high priority, demanding a permanent fix for this instability. We will maintain traffic on Tunnel 4 until the primary carrier link is confirmed stable.
 
Thanks.

I've only re-checked 3 stores (J804, J823, J809) and it seems that you've already reenabled tunnel 3?
Are all the affected stores back to normal now?

Also, did we get something from AT&T regarding the cause?

Hi Max,
 
Thank you for the report.
 
So does that mean the impacted sites' WAN1 are being redirected to HK at the moment?
As for the other stores, if there is no issue right now, then there is no need to make changes to them.
It may be a bit painstaking but please be on alert and remain on standby and address sites individually if we see a store other than the current ones impacted.
 
Kindest regards.

Hi Rosellier-san, Executive Summary: Operations are currently detecting significant instability on the Tunnel 3 network interfaces across the Japan region. Impact Assessment: Stores currently impacted: J809, J823, J309, J817, J346, J804. J217
Hi Rosellier-san,
 
Executive Summary: Operations are currently detecting significant instability on the Tunnel 3 network interfaces across the Japan region.
Impact Assessment:
•	Stores currently impacted: J809, J823, J309, J817, J346, J804. J217 
•	The list of affected sites is growing.
•	Business operations are normal since we have manually shut down the Tunnel3.  
Remediation & Escalation: We have temporarily disabled Tunnel 3 on the affected devices to stabilize connectivity. An escalation ticket has been opened with AT&T to identify the root cause.
Action Item - Please Advise: To mitigate potential impact on the remaining fleet, should we implement a precautionary shutdown of Tunnel 3 across the entire Japan region? Alternatively, we can remain on standby and address sites individually as tickets are raised.
 
Thanks.
 
 
Best Regards

## 🤖 Assistant

你好！我是哈基米。针对这封名为“Incident Report: Japan Network Degradation - Tunnel 3 Connectivity”的邮件，目前距离上一封邮件（1月15日）已经过去了11天。

在这段时间里，既然没有进一步的报错（Silence is usually gold in IT），通常意味着情况已经稳定，或者是大家忙于其他事务暂时搁置了根因分析。

为了既“委婉”又“动听”地催促，我们的策略是：**以“确认目前网络是否持续稳定”为切入点，温和地询问根本原因（Root Cause）的调查结果，并试探性地提出是否可以关闭此Case。** 这样既体现了你的负责（Follow-up），又不会给对方造成被逼问的压力。

以下为你提供三个不同侧重点的英文回复草稿，你可以根据实际情况选择：

---

# 邮件回复建议方案

## 1. 方案一：温和关怀型（最推荐，既动听又得体）
**适用场景**：你希望保持非常友好的关系，假设目前没有新投诉，想优雅地收尾或询问下一步。

**Subject:** RE: Incident Report: Japan Network Degradation - Tunnel 3 Connectivity

Hi Rosellier-san,

Hope you had a wonderful weekend.

Following up on our last correspondence regarding the Tunnel 3 connectivity issues. Since things have been relatively quiet on our monitoring dashboard since Jan 15th, I wanted to gently touch base to see if the situation has fully stabilized on your end as well.

Have we received any further updates or a definitive *RFO* (Reason for Outage) from Singtel/TCS regarding the packet loss? If the connection is deemed stable, please let us know if you would like us to maintain the current configuration or if we can proceed with closing this incident ticket.

Standing by for your advice.

Best Regards,

Max Zhao

> **解析**：
> *   开篇 "Hope you had a wonderful weekend" 奠定轻松基调。
> *   使用 "Things have been relatively quiet"（最近比较安静）来暗示没有新问题，比直接说 "No complaints" 更委婉。
> *   "Gently touch base"（温和地联系/对此事以此为基点进行沟通）是非常地道的职场软性用语。

## 2. 方案二：专业回访型（侧重于确认长期解决方案）
**适用场景**：你想确认之前说的“Singtel调查”到底有没有结果，显得非常专业且尽责。

**Subject:** RE: Incident Report: Japan Network Degradation - Tunnel 3 Connectivity

Hi Rosellier-san,

Checking in to ensure everything is running smoothly with the Japan store connectivity.

It has been over a week since we implemented the manual switch-overs and observed the drop in complaints. Could you kindly update us on the status of the joint investigation with Singtel? We want to ensure that the underlying instability has been permanently resolved before we consider reverting any traffic back to the primary links.

We are ready to assist with any further adjustments or testing if needed.

Best regards,

Max Zhao

> **解析**：
> *   "Checking in to ensure..." 是非常标准的专业跟进句式。
> *   重点放在 "Underlying instability"（潜在的不稳定性）上，表明你的催促是为了客户网络的长期安全，而非单纯为了催单。

## 3. 方案三：简洁高效型（如果对方很忙，用这个）
**适用场景**：对方是大忙人，只希望快速确认状态。

**Subject:** RE: Incident Report: Japan Network Degradation - Tunnel 3 Connectivity

Hi Rosellier-san,

Just a quick follow-up on this incident.

Given that store operations appear to have normalized since our last update on the 15th, could you please advise on the current status? Specifically, we are looking to confirm if Singtel has identified the root cause of the *Packet Loss*, or if we should continue monitoring under the current setup.

Looking forward to your guidance.

Best regards,

Max Zhao

> **解析**：
> *   "Just a quick follow-up" 开门见山，不浪费时间。
> *   直接询问是要 "Identify root cause"（确认根因）还是 "Continue monitoring"（继续监控），给了对方明确的选择题，容易获得回复。

# 关键术语与解释

在上述邮件中，我使用了一些网络运维领域的专业术语，以下是解释：

*   *RFO (Reason for Outage)*
> RFO: 故障原因分析报告。通常在重大网络事故解决后，由服务提供商（如Singtel/AT&T）出具的正式解释，说明故障发生的根本原因及预防措施。

*   *Packet Loss*
> Packet Loss: 丢包。指数据包在网络传输过程中未能到达目的地的现象。这是导致本次日本门店网络连接不稳定（Network Degradation）的主要技术症状。

# 总结

| 维度 | 建议内容 |
| :--- | :--- |
| **当前状态** | 距离上次沟通已过11天，投诉量下降，使用了临时切换方案（Tunnel 4/HK）。 |
| **催促目的** | 1. 确认目前网络是否真正稳定。<br>2. 追问Singtel/TCS的调查结果（根因）。<br>3. 询问下一步是关闭工单还是继续观察。 |
| **语气策略** | **"No news is good news"**（没有消息就是好消息）作为切入点，用“确认稳定性”代替“催问进度”，显得更体贴。 |
| **推荐方案** | **方案一**。用词最柔和（Gently touch base），最符合你要求的“委婉且动听”。 |

建议你在发送邮件前，再次快速检查一下SST内部的监控系统，确认过去24小时内日本到新加坡的链路确实没有大的红色报警，这样发邮件时会更有底气。
